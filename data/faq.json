    "question": "How can I choose the right Summer Camp for my child?",
    "answer": "Choosing the right camp involves considering your child's interests and readiness. Key elements to look for include a camp with a long history, a clear philosophy (e.g., sports, arts), an emphasis on creating a multinational community, a well-trained staff with a good staff-to-child ratio, and proper accreditation from international organizations. A good camp helps children separate from their families in a safe way to become resilient and independent."

    "question": "What actions are taken to ensure camper safety and wellbeing?",
    "answer": "The safety and wellbeing of campers is our most essential priority. Campers are cared for from the moment they arrive at the destination airport until the camp is over. All our camps are hosted in residential schools and are supervised 24/7 by specially trained counselors who provide optimum guidance and care. For our junior clients, we ensure a low leader-to-child ratio (1 to 5) for close supervision."
