        "question": "How can I choose the right Summer Camp for my child?",
        "answer": "<p>It's a question many parents struggle with. Some believe it is best to let kids roam and play in a way they rarely do these days. It takes them away from computers, TV, and other high-tech time-suckers, swapping them for conversation, fun, and games in a natural, multinational setting. And perhaps most important, camps are no-parent- zones. \"Kids have to learn how to separate from their families and become resilient and independent. Camp gives them a safe way to take these steps<br><br>Children are ready for camp experience away from home by age 9, especially if they've experienced day programs before. You just might have to give your child (and yourself) a little push.<br><br>What should you look for? While there are specific qualities that make some camps better for a certain child than others (a kid who loves art, for instance, might not be a good fit at a place that's all about horses)<br><br></p>\r\n<p>Key Elements when choosing a camp</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A history.</strong>&nbsp;A camp that is operating for decades, especially with same staff means something. In today's world, a camp simply couldn't stay in business for generations if it were unsafe or poorly run.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A philosophy.&nbsp;</strong>Does it focus on sports? Arts? Leadership? How is this philosophy integrated into its programs?</li>\r\n<li><strong>An emphasis on creating multinational community.&nbsp;</strong>Effective camps pay great attention to big mix of different nationalities and place children together observing their integration.</li>\r\n<li><strong>A well-trained staff.</strong>&nbsp;Staff ratio for children from 8 to 12 is normally 1 to 5. In older groups it may be one to 12 or 15.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Big variety of activity choices.</strong>&nbsp;Your child will feel more independent if he can choose some activities. Therefore a camp with big variety of actives is recommended.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Communications with your child.</strong>&nbsp;Many camps don't allow cell phones or calls home. Good camps send frequent updates, though, and have kids write emails or Skype at given certain times previously planned. You have to respect this! To let go and help your child to integrate. Still, what if you (or your child) can't stand the thought of being so detached? Well, perhaps camp isn't the right fit. Or maybe that's precisely why you need it. \"If you are successful as a parent, your child is going to leave you at some point. A child's first experience away from you is part of the process of parenting and should be a happy, exciting growth experience for him and for you as well.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Accreditation.</strong> You probably assume that all children's summer camps must meet standards. Check if your chosen camp is accredited by well-known organizations. Such International Organizations conduct on-site visits and reviews programs, facilities, as well as operating staff. Accreditation is the best evidence that a camp has made a commitment to health and safety. Always ask about this.</li>\r\n</ul>"

        "question": "How should I prepare my child for camp?",
        "answer": "<ul>\r\n<li>Label everything that your child is taking with them with a fabric marker or iron-on label.</li>\r\n<li>Make sure all health forms are completed. It is important to provide the camp all the necessary information, including potentially embarrassing things such as sleep walking or bed wetting.</li>\r\n<li>Have your child spend a night or two with a friend or grandparent so that he / she can experience sleeping away from home before camp.</li>\r\n<li>Make sure your child can manage basic personal hygiene such as showering, brushing teeth and changing clothes. Children need to know how to select appropriate clothing, make a bed with clean sheets, put clothes away, handle laundry etc.</li>\r\n<li>Discuss with your child what will happen at camp and encourage him / her to get excited about the experience he / she will have. Camp is often a child's first step towards independence and plays an important role in their development.</li>\r\n</ul>"
